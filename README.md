## How to Use

### Taking Measurements

1. **Heart Girth**: Measure around the animal just behind the front legs
2. **Length**: Measure from the base of the ears to the base of the tail

### Using the App

1. Select the animal type (Pig, Cattle, Sheep, or Goat)
2. Enter the heart girth measurement in inches
3. Enter the length measurement in inches
4. Tap "Calculate Weight" to get the estimated weight
5. View measurement history in the History tab

### Calculation Formula

The app uses the following formula:
```
Weight (lbs) = (Heart Girth¬≤) √ó Length √∑ Coefficient
```

**Animal Coefficients:**
- Pig: 400
- Cattle: 300
- Sheep: 500
- Goat: 450

### Example

For a pig with Heart Girth: 50" and Length: 40":
```
Weight = (50 √ó 50) √ó 40 √∑ 400 = 250 pounds
```
